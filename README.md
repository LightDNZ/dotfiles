## Welcome !

This may be the worst dotfiles you'll ever see, but at least I liked it

There 2 branches - **main** for the vsc settings and **Master** for arch dotfiles


## Features

- Theme/Wallpaper Selector
- Can possibly run in any linux without needing making another configs



## Usage

You will need [Hyde](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE) and a fresh install of any linux( i use arch btw )
